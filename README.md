# Keylogger
Just built a Python-based keylogger that captures every keystroke along with the active window title and saves the logs automatically to the Desktop. It runs silently in the background and can start automatically on system boot, ensuring continuous monitoring without interruptions.

💡 Key features:
✅ Keystroke logging with timestamps
✅ Active window tracking to see which app was in use
✅ Auto-save logs directly to the Desktop
✅ Runs in the background without user detection

🔹 Built using:
✔️ pynput → Keystroke monitoring
✔️ pygetwindow → Active window tracking
✔️ os & time → File handling and timestamps
